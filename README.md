## Disclaimer

Might not be well written and might not behave exactly like ranger's bulkrename.

I'm not pretending this is a droped in replacement, and I'm not pretending this is efficient.

Contributions and improvements are welcome. :)

## Copyright

This is trivial enough for not being subject to copyright of any kind imho. Do what you want with it.
